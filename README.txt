The Kenya_treatment branch uses Gui's original Kenya_National branch and adds in the following components: 

- Single dose vaccine efficacy from the KEN-SHE results presented at IPVC 2023
- CC treatment and symptomatic detection
- Gradual scale up of vaccine coverage 

This branch was developed for the Kenya single dose CEA.
